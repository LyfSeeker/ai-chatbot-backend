This is a comprehensive test document for the AI chatbot backend. It demonstrates the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) functionality with vector embeddings and semantic search capabilities. The system uses OpenAI embeddings to convert text into 1536-dimensional vectors stored in pgvector. This allows for intelligent document retrieval based on semantic similarity rather than just keyword matching.
